# Lung Nodule ML
The goal of this project is to become more familiar with different machine learning techniques. I'll be using the [LIDC-IDRI](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/LIDC-IDRI) dataset from the phenomenal [Cancer Imaging Archive](http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/) as a way to apply what I'm learning.
